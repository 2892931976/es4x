Want to report a bug? Before you do, please read the following guidelines. Submission context \u00b6 Got a question or problem? \u00b6 For quick questions there's no need to open an issue as you can reach us on gitter.im . Found a bug? \u00b6 If you found a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to the issue tracker in our GitHub repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. However, before doing so, please read the submission guidelines . Missing a feature? \u00b6 You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that it is of use for everyone, as the Material theme is highly opinionated. Please consider what kind of change it is: For a major feature , first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project. Small features and bugs can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request. However, there is no guarantee that your feature will make it into the master, as it's always a matter of opinion whether if benefits the overall functionality of the theme. Submission guidelines \u00b6 Submitting an issue \u00b6 Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available. We want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using the custom issue template. Please stick to the issue template. Unfortunately we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction scenario, so if we don't hear back from you we may close the issue. Submitting a Pull Request (PR) \u00b6 Search GitHub for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort. If you do not find a related issue or PR, go ahead. Development : Fork the project, make your changes in a separate git branch and add descriptive messages to your commits. Build : Before submitting a pull requests, build the project. This is a mandatory requirement for your PR to get accepted, as the theme should at all times be installable through GitHub. Pull Request : After building the theme, commit the compiled output, push your branch to GitHub and send a PR to es4x:develop . If we suggest changes, make the required updates, rebase your branch and push the changes to your GitHub repository, which will automatically update your PR. After your PR is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","text":"Interested in contributing to the ES4X?

The same code will run either on Nashorn (JS Engine in JDK>=8) or GraalJS (if run on GraalVM or a JVMCI enabled JVM). There are benefits on using GraalJS namely the updated language support >=ES6 and support out of the box for generators, promises, etc.... The downsides are that the engine is not in 1 to 1 parity of features to the old Nashorn, for example, Nashorn allows the usage of property names to refer to getters and setters, while Graal is strict. For example: class Hello { private String name ; public String getName () { return name ; } public void setName ( String name ) { this . name = name ; } } When using this Java Object from Nashorn one could get and set the name as: var hello = new Hello (); // get the name var name = hello . name ; // set the name hello . name = 'Paulo' ; This is not valid in Graal and should be: var hello = new Hello (); // get the name var name = hello . getName (); // set the name hello . setName ( 'Paulo' ); While Nashorn would not complain when using threads or being executed from different threads, GraalJS will not allow this, so you should ensure that you're always executing in the right context. If there is a need to work with multiple threads, then consider looking at the Worker API . Native Images \u00b6 Currently you cannot generate native images with ES4X, the limitation is because the static analysis of the AOT compiler will not take in consideration the java code invoked from the script (so classes won't be available), plus the fact that the compiler has no support for jvm interop at runtime. REPL / Shell \u00b6 Every ES4X project can run within a very simple REPL. This shell will take scripts line by line and evaluate the result, so there is currently no support for multiline scripts. To start a REPL you can execute: java -cp your_fatjar.jar io.reactiverse.es4x.Shell If you need to pass arguments to your REPL, say for example, that you would like to have cluster support, then use the kebab notation in the arguments as: java -cp your_fatjar.jar io.reactiverse.es4x.Shell -clustered If the last argument is not in the kebab format it is assumed that is the startup script and will be executed on start: java -cp your_fatjar.jar io.reactiverse.es4x.Shell -clustered ./index.js","title":"GraalVM"},{"location":"advanced/graalvm/#native-images","text":"Currently you cannot generate native images with ES4X, the limitation is because the static analysis of the AOT compiler will not take in consideration the java code invoked from the script (so classes won't be available), plus the fact that the compiler has no support for jvm interop at runtime.","title":"Native Images"},{"location":"advanced/graalvm/#repl-shell","text":"Every ES4X project can run within a very simple REPL.

The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface. ES4X is not a Browser and does not concern about user interface, however you can also run long running jobs on the server side. In Vert.x everything is non blocking so even creating workers should follow the same semantics, for this reason we cannot fully strict follow the worker interface but we replace the constructor with a factory function. Imagine that in your code you need to run a CPU intensive task, you shouldn't block the event loop, so the logic step is to use vert.x worker verticles. Worker API can be mapped to Vert.x API with some small nuances. Example Worker \u00b6 Imagine the following worker code: // Get a reference to the Thread class to cause some blocking... const Thread = Java . type ( 'java.lang.Thread' ); // The worker context is referenced by the variable `self` like on the MDN docs self . onmessage = function ( e ) { console . log ( 'Message received from main script, will sleep 5 seconds...' ); // Cause some havok in the event loop Thread . sleep ( 5 * 1000 ); var workerResult = 'Result: ' + ( e . data [ 0 ] * e . data [ 1 ]); console . log ( 'Posting message back to main script' ); // return data back to the main verticle postMessage ( workerResult ); }; What needs to be known \u00b6 Workers are loaded in a seperate context so you can't share functions from the main verticle and worker, all communication works with message passing (eventbus) using: postMessage() sends a message to the other side onmessage receives a message from the other side Verticle side \u00b6 The verticle side of the API allows you to receive errors and terminate() workers, while the worker it self can't. Example Verticle \u00b6 Worker . create ( 'workers/worker.js' , function ( create ) { if ( create . succeeded ()) { var worker = create . result (); worker . onmessage = function ( msg ) { console . log ( 'onmessage: ' + msg ); }; worker . onerror = function ( err ) { console . err ( err ); // terminate the worker worker . terminate (); }; console . log ( 'posting...' ); worker . postMessage ({ data : [ 2 , 3 ]}); } }); So the code that would be not allowed to run on the event loop Thread.sleep(5000) is now running on a worker thread leaving the event loop thread free for all the other IO tasks. Polyglot Workers \u00b6 It is still possible to write workers that are not JavaScript workers. Workers must follow a very small list of rules: Workers must register the address: {deploymentId}.out to receive messages from the main script. Workers should send messages to: {deploymentId}.in to send messages to the main script. Message payloads are expected to be JSON.stringify(message) to avoid any issues between languages Workers are expected to be local, if want to connect to a worker anywhere in the cluster, then you need to use the constructor with an extra argument true , e.g.: new Worker('deploymentId', true) .","title":"Workers"},{"location":"advanced/worker/#example-worker","text":"Imagine the following worker code: // Get a reference to the Thread class to cause some blocking... const Thread = Java . type ( 'java.lang.Thread' ); // The worker context is referenced by the variable `self` like on the MDN docs self . onmessage = function ( e ) { console . log ( 'Message received from main script, will sleep 5 seconds...' ); // Cause some havok in the event loop Thread . sleep ( 5 * 1000 ); var workerResult = 'Result: ' + ( e . data [ 0 ] * e . data [ 1 ]); console . log ( 'Posting message back to main script' ); // return data back to the main verticle postMessage ( workerResult ); };","title":"Example Worker"},{"location":"advanced/worker/#what-needs-to-be-known","text":"Workers are loaded in a seperate context so you can't share functions from the main verticle and worker, all communication works with message passing (eventbus) using: postMessage() sends a message to the other side onmessage receives a message from the other side","title":"What needs to be known"},{"location":"advanced/worker/#verticle-side","text":"The verticle side of the API allows you to receive errors and terminate() workers, while the worker it self can't.","title":"Verticle side"},{"location":"advanced/worker/#example-verticle","text":"Worker . create ( 'workers/worker.js' , function ( create ) { if ( create . succeeded ()) { var worker = create . result (); worker . onmessage = function ( msg ) { console . log ( 'onmessage: ' + msg ); }; worker . onerror = function ( err ) { console . err ( err ); // terminate the worker worker . terminate (); }; console . log ( 'posting...' ); worker . postMessage ({ data : [ 2 , 3 ]}); } }); So the code that would be not allowed to run on the event loop Thread.sleep(5000) is now running on a worker thread leaving the event loop thread free for all the other IO tasks.","title":"Example Verticle"},{"location":"advanced/worker/#polyglot-workers","text":"It is still possible to write workers that are not JavaScript workers.
